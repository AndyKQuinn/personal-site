There are many static site generators available, each with its own set of features and capabilities. Some popular options include:

- Jekyll: A popular open-source static site generator that is widely used for creating blogs and websites.

- Hugo: A static site generator that is designed to be fast and easy to use.
- Next.js: A React-based static site generator that is known for its speed and performance.
