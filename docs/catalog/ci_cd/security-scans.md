Security scans are a critical component of CI/CD pipelines. They help identify vulnerabilities and weaknesses in software applications and infrastructure, allowing for timely remediation and prevention of potential security breaches.

In a CI/CD pipeline, security scans are typically performed as part of the build process. They can be automated using tools such as Nessus or OpenVAS, which scan for known vulnerabilities in the code and configuration of the application.

Security scans can also be performed manually by team members or security experts, who review the code and configuration for any potential vulnerabilities. This can help identify and address security issues before they become a problem.

Overall, security scans play a crucial role in ensuring the security and integrity of software applications and infrastructure in a CI/CD pipeline.
