Product ownership is a key concept in agile software development. It refers to the process of identifying and managing the ownership of a product, including its features, functionality, and requirements. This involves defining the product's vision, goals, and objectives, as well as identifying the stakeholders and their roles and responsibilities.

The product ownership process typically involves the following steps:

1. Define the product vision: This involves identifying the product's purpose, value proposition, and unique selling proposition. It also involves defining the product's target market and the benefits it provides to the customer.
2. Identify the product's features and functionality: This involves defining the product's core features and functionality, as well as any additional features or capabilities that are required for the product to meet its goals.
