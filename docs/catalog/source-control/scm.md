Source control is a critical component of software development. It allows developers to track changes to their code, collaborate with other developers, and manage the history of their work.

Git is a popular version control system that is widely used in the software development industry. It provides a distributed, decentralized model for managing code changes and collaborating with other developers.

GitHub and Bitbucket are popular platforms for hosting and managing Git repositories. They provide features such as code review, issue tracking, and pull requests, which help streamline the development process and ensure code quality.

Overall, source control is a vital tool for managing code changes and collaborating with other developers in a software development project.
