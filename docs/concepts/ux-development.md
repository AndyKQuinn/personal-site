# User Experience (UX) Development

I am currently working towards a specialization in Usability (UX) and UI Design.

## Inspiration

I am inspired
by the work of Steve Krug via his book [Don't Make Me Think](https://www.amazon.com/s?k=steve+krug+don%27t+make+me+think&i=stripbooks&hvadid=283120739932&hvdev=c&hvlocphy=9019695&hvnetw=g&hvqmt=e&hvrand=3779425351309067874&hvtargid=kwd-299456992030&hydadcr=16431_10305303&tag=googhydr-20&ref=pd_sl_gs4sqnkil_e)
