# Create T3 App

I was told about CT3A via former Twitch dev Theo, and honestly, C3TA is pretty awesome. It is overwhelming
at first, but what it provides is a wonderful boilerplate to begin projects from. If you're new to JS it may
be too heavy to absorb, but once you're over the initial hump, I found it to be quite enjoyable overall.
