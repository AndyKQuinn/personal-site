# Next

It basically replaced React and `create-react-app`, so I figured I may as well get used to it. Turns out, it's pretty
solid. App router is still not my favorite, but again - as JavaScript seems to do, I got worn down by the pains of it
and eventually started to warm up to Next.js...

...is this an abusive relationship? JavaScript - come on!!! GET BETTER! hah...
